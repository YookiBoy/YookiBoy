Hi, My name is Enes GÃ¶cuncu. I was born in 2004. I live in Stockholm. I studied Technology with a focus on System Developer at LBS Stockholm Norra (2020 - 2023). 
I speak three languages, Swedish, English, Turkish. 

I like to go to gym, play basketball, play video games, read "Life Changer, Discipline, Economy and Coding" books and coding in my spare time. 
I also grew up with computers all my life  therefore I am comfortable with technology etc.

I started programming in 2017 with HTML5 and CSS3 and a little JavaScript it was difficult for me so I could not continue with it.
I have been working with HTML and CSS for almost 4 years now (2021). I started learning JavaScript, because I wanted to be a Front-end Developer.
Right now I am working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
